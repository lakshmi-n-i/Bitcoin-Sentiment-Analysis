# Bitcoin-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis on Bitcoin tweets using LSTM networks. VADER sentiment analysis provided compound sentiment scores. The deep learning model, with convolutional, pooling, bidirectional LSTM layers, achieved high accuracy (0.8580), precision (0.8849), recall (0.8345), and F1 score (0.8590), indicating its effectiveness.

# Results
The following joint plots visualize the kernel density estimation (KDE) of the sentiment analysis scores. For the first plot, the x-axis represents the positive sentiment scores, while the y-axis represents the negative sentiment scores. This joint plot allows us to observe the distribution of sentiment scores and identify any trends or patterns between positive and negative sentiments in the data. The second jointplot between "vader_pos" and "vader_neu" visualizes the KDE of positive sentiment scores against neutral sentiment scores. This plot helps in understanding the relationship between positive and neutral sentiments in the dataset and provides insights into how often positive sentiments co-occur with neutral sentiments.
